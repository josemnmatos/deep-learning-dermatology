For each of the Models, we will be performing the following experiments:

1. MLP with raw data
2. CNN with raw data

Experiment 1: Model Layer Architecture

-> fix loss fn
-> fix optimizer
-> fix lr 
-> fix epochs

-> fix the seed values for reproducibility


Experiment 2: Loss Functions

-> try different loss functions
-> compare the performance of each loss function
-> fix the rest of the hyperparameters


Experiment 3: Optimizers

-> try different optimizers with different learning rates
-> compare the performance of each optimizer
-> fix the rest of the hyperparameters
